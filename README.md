Titanic Survival Prediction: Comparing Machine Learning Models 🚢📊
Project Overview: In this project, 
I analyzed the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using three different classification models:
✅ Logistic Regression → Works well for binary classification problems.
✅ Decision Tree → Captures non-linear relationships but may overfit.
✅ Random Forest → An ensemble method that reduces overfitting.

Key Metrics & Results: 📊 AUC Scores (Area Under the Curve for model comparison):

Logistic Regression AUC: 0.87 🚀 Strong linear performance.

Decision Tree AUC: 0.77 ⚡ Decent but can be improved with pruning.

Random Forest AUC: 0.83 🌳 Performs better due to averaging multiple trees.

🛠 Approach: 
1️⃣ Cleaned and preprocessed the Titanic dataset (handled missing values). 
2️⃣ Trained three models on selected features (Pclass, Age, SibSp, Fare). 
3️⃣ Compared their performance using ROC curves and AUC scores. 
4️⃣ Visualized results using matplotlib ROC curves for better model evaluation.
